							<h1>Final Reflection</h1>
							When I first started taking the Capstone course, I had no idea what I wanted to pursue as a project. I was just taking the course because it was the next step in the progression of computer science. The original goal I set out for myself was to learn how to use Python to develop an app or to create a website. Although I started in a course to learn Python, I switched to an online course in html on Compuscholar. As I went through the course on compuscholar I made a website based on what it showed me, on birds. After I had enough of the course under my belt, I started to create my own professional website. I wanted to create a website where people could find out more information about me and find my resume, projects, and contact information. After I finished my site, I still got to learn Python even though I switched away from app development. My second project involved me using Python on a website called codespace, which allowed me to code a codebot while learning about what all of the parts of the robot did and how I could control it using Python. I met my smart goals in some way, except for the part about possibly creating my own app. I was able to learn python through the codebot instead of creating an app. Also, I was able to still create my own website, but I used html. I did not accomplish my exact smart goals, but by doing this I was able to learn two languages instead of one and was able to expand my knowledge in a more engineering based project. 
	<br><br>One problem that I struggled with a lot was publishing my website on Github. I dealt with it by asking my classmates and Mrs. Connell for help. I also kept trying different methods of getting it onto Github whenever I was hitting a dead end. Another problem I was having with the codebot is that sometimes the code would not act in the way I wanted it to. For example, if you let the bot spin for too long with the sleep command it may mess up the whole thing you were trying to accomplish. I had to keep testing out different speeds and sleep durations, until I could get it to work properly. If I built my website again, I would want to build more of it from scratch. I really liked the template that I used to help me build it, but I would have liked to learn more about animation and building the website up from being a skeleton into a full blown website. If I worked with the codebot again, I would have liked to finish the course so that I could fully understand the sensors and control the movements of the bot more. I wish I understood more of how it worked so that I could create more original commands on my own.
	<br><br>From creating my website I learned how to code using html and a lot about how to professionally format information so that it looks organized and well-done. I also learned how to use VS code and got to explore github. By working with the codebot, I was able to learn how to code using python. I learned the syntax needed in python and was able to refine my coding skills through it. The soft skills I learned in capstone were that I need to better manage my time when working on projects in the workforce. Working on my website and with the codebot, if I did not do my work I would fall behind and it made it harder for me to accomplish my goals. I also learned how to problem solve. A lot of times when I was using the codebot I would have to use trial and error to accomplish a task. I had to keep reevaluating my code to try and figure out where I went wrong. This led me to keep editing my work until I was able to find the correct answer to a problem. From this I learned that I do work well when I have the information out in front of me like it was in the modules I used to learn the new languages. I also realized that sometimes if I do not keep myself to a strict schedule I procrastinate, and may fall behind. I would have made myself a more organized schedule and set out goals for myself to reach at the end of each week, to make sure I got my work done in a timely fashion.
	<br><br>I would tell other students who were going to create their own website or develop something similar to set up a plan for yourself and have a checkmark to complete by the end of each week in school, and if you donâ€™t reach it to work on it on the weekend. This would have been really helpful to me, and could have helped me to stay on top of my work better. If I had more time to work on my codebot project, I would like to finish the course on codespace and also have created my own challenges for the robot to complete. I would like to do that so I could test my abilities in a more creative way when using it rather than doing something more structured like it was in the course.
	<br><br>Overall I really enjoyed the two projects I did in capstone. I feel that my website will be a really good resource to have when I am ready to apply for an internship or to be able to show what I have learned in computer science in high school. I also really liked the codebot project, because it allowed me to explore physical computing and to work on a project that may be similar to what I am doing in college with an engineering major.
