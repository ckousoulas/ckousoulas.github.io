							<h1>Initial Proposal</h1>
<h3>First Semester</h3>
S-Learn Python and Create an app<br>
M-Develop 1 app, as it will take time to first learn Python and then to create an app.<br>
A-I can accomplish the goal by watching videos and reading online sources to help me learn python. Then applying that knowledge into making my own app.<br>
R-I would like my app to be relevant and in some way help with what is going on at this time(But I do not yet know what I really want to do or create).<br>
T-I would assume that my goal will take anywhere from 3-6 months. I do not know how long exactly it would take me to learn enough of python to create an app so I would guess 2-3 months for that and an additional 2-3 to physically make the app and fix any bugs that may come with it.<br>
<br>
<h3>Second Semester</h3>
S- I want to use a codebot to learn the basics of python. From here I can then see the effects of physical computing, by being able to program the robot to do what I want.<br>
M- I would like to make my way through the course on codespace and complete all of the units and projects.<br>
A- I feel that I can accomplish this goal if I manage to stay on track throughout the second semester. I may have a few struggles that delay me but I do feel like I could finish the course and understand the codebot over a few months of working with it.<br>
R- If I am successful in this project, it could be really telling for what I want to do in the future. Since I am going to major in engineering, physical computing may be a large part of what I am going to do in college and can help narrow my interests in the engineering field.<br>
T- I hope to reach my goal by the end of the second semester and hopefully understand the basic gist of python by that time.<br>
